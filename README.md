# Object-Segmentation
 This Project was made to learn what object segmentation really does 
if you want to test it make sure you provide proper images for it to perform image segmentation ,
there are only a few objects that it can detect as it was given that training data before ,
imp:  the number shown is used to determine what the object is as the list is predefined however you can change it if needed .
Thank you .
